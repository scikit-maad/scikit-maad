Simple audio segmentation
=========================

In audio signals, regions of interest are usually regions with high density of energy. The function ``find_rois_cwt`` allows finding regions of interest in the signal giving very simple and intuitive parameters: temporal length and frequency limits. This segmentation can be seen as a coarse detection process, the starting point of more advanced classification methods.

The following sound example as two main different soundtypes in the foreground:

- A bouncy trill between 4.5 and 8 kHz lasting approximately 2 seconds.
- A fast descending chirp between 8 and 12 kHz lasting 0.1 approximately seconds.
