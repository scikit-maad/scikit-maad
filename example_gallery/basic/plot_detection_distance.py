Detection distance estimation
==============================

When sound travels in air (or in water), initial acoustic signature may change
regarding distances due to attenuation. Sound attenuation in natural environment
is very complex to model. We propose to reduce the complexity by decomposing
the sound attenuation to three main sources of attenuation:
- the geometric attenuation (Ageo) also known as spreading loss or geometric
dispersion,
- the atmospheric attenuation (Aatm)
- and the habitat attenuation (Ahab). The later encompasses several sources of
attenuation and might be seen as a proxy.

Knowing the attenuation law and the sound level at each frequency, it is
possible to estimate the detection distance of each frequency component of
that sound

In this example, we will estimate the detection distance of each frequency
component of a sound that travels in rainforest at noon, when the ambient
sound level is the lowest.
